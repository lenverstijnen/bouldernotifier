# BouderNotifier

For bouldering during corona time you are only allowed to book one slot in advance. There is one exception, if you are able to get a boulder slot that starts in one hour or less, you can take that slot even if you have booked a slot later that week. This resulted in refreshing the TopLogger page every seccond of the day to see if someone cancelled his / her slot.

I decided to make a script that notifies me by sending a Telegram message when a spot comes available whitin the hour. For moral reason I made it open source so anyone can take advantage of it.
