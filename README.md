# BouderNotifier

During the corona pandemic it is not easy to book a boulderslot, since many climbers try to book a slot and there are limited places. This resulted in refreshing the TopLogger page every seccond of the day to see if a slot comes free.

I decided to make a script that notifies me by sending a Telegram message when a spot comes available whitin the hour. For moral reasons I made it open source so anyone can take advantage of the script.
